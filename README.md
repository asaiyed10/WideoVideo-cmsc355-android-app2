-In this iteration, we created the basic UI for our app. We can mostly navigate around the activities using the current UI. We will implement more functions to it in later iterations. 

-The camera activity (the activity linked to Record button) works best with API 21. The Nexus 5X API 24 (Nougat) couldn't even open its built in camera so it wouldn't work with this app.

-The settings activity doesn't change the camera's values yet. It contains the buttons for now.

-The Espresso tests should be run individually. When bundled together, they don't run very well (may be it only happens on my emulator).
